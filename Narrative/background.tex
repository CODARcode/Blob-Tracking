\section{Related Work}

Our method is mainly related to feature tracking techniques and scalar field topology theories.  

\subsection{Feature Tracking}

Feature tracking is a well-studied problem in scientific visualization.  

Existing blob tracking in fusion plasma~\cite{WuWSCCSCK16}.  Experimental data~\cite{DavisKMRSZ14}.  



\subsection{Scalar Field Topology}

Scalar field topology is 



Magnetic flux vortex tracking~\cite{GuoPPKG16, GuoPG17, PhillipsGPKG16, PhillipsPKG15}.

Critical point tracking~\cite{ReininghausKWH12}.

High-dimensional merge tree~\cite{OesterlingHWMS17}. 

Feature flow fields~\cite{TheiselS03}.
