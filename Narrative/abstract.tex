We are developing techniques to robustly extract, track, and visualize blob features in large scale 5D gyrokinetic Tokamak simulations.  Blobs, regions of high turbulence that can damage the Tokamak, can run along the edge wall down toward the diverter and damage it.  We define blobs as topological critical points in every single 2D mesh plane, i.e. maxima, minima, and saddles in scalar field topology theory.  The input data are loaded from ADIOS and then preconditioned with the robust PCA algorithm.  We then associate the blobs across all 2D planes and over time by tracking the critical points with combinatorial feature flow fields.  We are also developing event graphs of births, deaths, mergers, and bifurcations with novel visualization designs.  
We anticipate that our new data analysis and visualization techniques will help fusion scientists understand the behavior of blob dynamics in greater detail than previously possible. 

% , which are the result of blob tracking done on experimental microscopy rather than simulations.
% Blob extraction and tracking enables the exploration and analysis of high-energy blobs across timesteps.
