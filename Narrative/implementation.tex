The scalar electrostatic potential field is stored in a unique unstructured mesh structure.  In general the data consist of multiple slices that uniformly partition the angular space domain in $[0, 2\pi)$, and each slice shares the same 2D triangular mesh structure.  The triangular mesh consists a list of vertex coordinates and their connections, and the electrostatic potential values are stored in a vector; each component of the vector records the scalar value on a vertex.  Data in different timesteps are stored in individual \texttt{.bp} files in the ADIOS format.  We are working with Dave Pugmire from ORNL to load the archival data from ADIOS I/O and convert the data into the VTK format.
